      <description>Connecting the NeoPixels to the Raspberry Pi  This will likely be the shortest post in the series, as I do not have expertise in electronics. I also cannot solder well, and I am sure my (surprisingly many) electrical engineering friends will get a laugh. So, I will just describe the steps I took.
The Raspberry Pi outputs 3.3v and the NeoPixels or WS2811/2812 requires 5v. It is possible to get some number of LEDs to work without a 5v power supply, but it&amp;rsquo;s not the best solution.</description>

      <description>Introduction  In my apartment is a small built in desk that I have converted into a bar. This was done by simply adding some liquor bottles and a Boston shaker. So now that we both have a bar, it might be nice to light the bar up with individually addressable LEDs. The following series of posts will discuss how to set up a Raspberry Pi, hook up the NeoPixels (ws2811) to the Raspberry Pi, create an API with Go, connect to the API with iPhone shortcuts, and finally how to make a cocktail to enjoy.</description>
